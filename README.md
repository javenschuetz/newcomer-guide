# Purpose
Simple program to act as a fun guide to learning coding with secrets if they look at the source code.

(This is for a friend who decided to learn some coding as a hobby!)

## Usage

Requires:
    - python3
    - python3-tk

Invoke with:
    - ```python3 app.py```


#### known bugs:

    - the draw_flower program crashes if you run it multiple times in a row, probably because there is no teardown
    - my python is incredibly rusty and this was done in an afternoon from memory and googling syntax.

#### License
I'll make it GPL 3 eventually but too lazy to copy the text in. I'll add it if ever somebody requests it

#### Contributing
The idea is a small interactive guidebook for somebody completely new to programming. I'd love inputs on how to make this more useful for people.
