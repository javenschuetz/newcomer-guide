# Purpose
Simple program to act as a fun guide to where to start learning to code. Has secrets if the user decides to 'cheat.'

(This is for a friend who decided to learn some coding as a hobby!)

## Usage

Requires:

    - python3
    - python3-tk

Invoke with:

    - ```python3 app.py```


#### known bugs:

    - the draw_flower program crashes if you run it multiple times in a row, probably because there is no teardown
    - there are ugly messages when you open a link, but the app continues to work

## Disclaimer
I don't actually use python often, but my friend did, so I used python. Please forgive any ugliness!
